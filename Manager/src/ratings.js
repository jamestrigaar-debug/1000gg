/* ============================================================================
 * FOOTBALL MANAGER — ROLE RATINGS AND HIDDEN ATTRIBUTES
 *
 * Adopted from the reference report on how FM-class engines turn attributes
 * into ability. Two ideas from it are worth having, and one is not.
 *
 * WORTH HAVING — position-specific attribute weighting (report formula 1).
 * Until now a player's contribution was his `overall` scaled by a position
 * weight, which meant two 74-rated wingers were interchangeable. Now each role
 * asks for the attributes it actually needs: a winger is read on pace, a
 * centre-half on heading and strength, a midfielder on both feet. The database
 * shipped in src/data.js carries those attributes for all 24,000 players and
 * was barely being used.
 *
 * WORTH HAVING — hidden attributes as long-term multipliers (report section 2).
 * Consistency, injury proneness and work rate are rolled per player, never
 * shown as numbers, and act across a season rather than per action.
 *
 * NOT ADOPTED — the report's core recommendation of an agent-based, four-
 * slices-per-second match engine. This game simulates roughly 5,000 matches
 * per season across ten divisions in about 160ms, because the whole design is
 * that the world keeps living while you make one decision a year. Per-slice
 * agent modelling is on the order of ten million operations per match; it is
 * the right architecture for a game where you watch one match, and the wrong
 * one for a game where you watch none.
 *
 * CALIBRATION NOTE
 * roleRating is deliberately ZERO-CENTRED against the player's own average. It
 * asks "is he better at THIS role's demands than at everything else?", not
 * "how good is he?". That keeps `overall` as the anchor the whole world is
 * calibrated on, and prevents the weighting from silently inflating or
 * deflating every rating in the game.
